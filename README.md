imp-helpers
===========

A collection of base object definitions for use with the Electric Imp, this is designed to be a shared repository for software - please add new sensor or update implementations as you have them. Ideally, we can make a common set of base objects for Electric Imp projects that can be used in a mix-and-match format.

Comments for new implementations should abide by the following
